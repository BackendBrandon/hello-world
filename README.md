# hello-world
This is my first Git Hub repository. I am here to learn as much as i can about my language of choice (python) and the many powers that come with it. I intend for my first big project to be on algorithmic trading, either through quantopian or alpaca. Thank you for visiting my page. I am open to anyone with sound advice and/or a mentor or two.project
